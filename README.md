## Issues with aiSuite Integration and Gemini

This document highlights the challenges and errors encountered while attempting to integrate and run aiSuite with Gemini.

### 1. aiSuite Integration Not Supported for Gemini
- The aiSuite library currently does not support integration with the Gemini LLM.
- This limitation makes it impossible to proceed with experiments or API calls involving Gemini through aiSuite.

### 2. Lack of Free APIs
- No free API keys for Gemini were found, further preventing testing or development.
- This restricts the ability to evaluate the functionality of Gemini with or without aiSuite integration.

### 3. Proxy Errors
- Even when attempting to run with other setups, repeated proxy errors were encountered:
  -.

### 4. Unable to Run Due to Proxies Errors
- Despite various attempts, running the setup resulted in persistent proxy-related issues.



### Conclusion
Due to the lack of aiSuite support for Gemini, absence of free APIs, and persistent proxy errors, it is currently not feasible to successfully integrate and run Gemini using aiSuite.
